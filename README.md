In Chapter Before, Learning to Work with Geometries, we showed you all the basic geometries
provided by Three.js. Besides these basic geometries, Three.js also offers a set of more
advanced and specialized objects. In this chapter, we'll show you these advanced
geometries and cover the following subjects:

- How to use advanced geometries such as THREE.ConvexGeometry, THREE.LatheGeometry, and THREE.TubeGeometry.
- How to create 3D shapes from 2D shapes using THREE.ExtrudeGeometry. We'll do this based on a 2D shape drawn using functionality provided by Three.js, and we'll show an example where we create a 3D shape based on an externally loaded SVG image.
- If you want to create custom shapes yourself, you can easily amend / change the ones we've discussed in the previous chapters. Three.js, however, also offers
  a THREE.ParametricGeometry object. With this object, you can create a geometry based on a set of equations.
- Finally, we'll look at how you can create 3D text effects using THREE.TextGeometry.
- Additionally, we'll also show you how you can create new geometries from existing ones using binary operations provided by the Three.js extension, ThreeBSP.

We'll start with the first one from this list, THREE.ConvexGeometry
