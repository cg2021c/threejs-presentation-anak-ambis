# ConvexGeometry

With THREE.ConvexGeometry, we can create a convex hull from a set of points. A convex hull is the minimal shape that encompasses all these points. The easiest way to understand this is by looking at an example. If you open up the 01-advanced-3d-geometriesconvex.html example, you'll see the convex hull for a random set of points. The following screenshot shows this geometry:

## concepts

- generate points
  - positions, (add geo and mesh. optional)
  - group the points
- pass the points to ConvexGeometry
- add mesh and render
